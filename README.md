# Volcano project

## Overview

The **Volcano Project** is a training app to learn map functionality in the folium library. The app uses a Volcanoes.txt dataset (included in the repo) to create a HTML page producing a custom map with markers and metadata for all the worldwide volcanoes. The map is fully customisable and allows for extras like heat densities and customer markers to be added easily. 

## Features

- Maps volcanos around the world with meta data. Also allows for custom markers to be added.
